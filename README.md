App to control the RGB on Cooler Master Masterkeys keyboards. Currently only supports the MasterKeys L keyboard and is aimed at the x64 platform with the target framework being the .NET Framework 4.5.2. This app utilizes the SDK that Cooler Master provides for their MasterKeys keyboards. The SDK is in the form of a .dll written in c++, the first version of this app was written using c++ however I decided to change it over to using C# as implementing certain features are much easier eg: Registering for system events such as unlock and lock of the pc. This project was mainly started as an experiment and has helped with learning how to optimise code and algorithims to create less of a load on the cpu.<br>
